Introduction
Bug bounty hunting is a process where ethical hackers identify vulnerabilities in a company‚Äôs online assets and get rewarded for their efforts. Upon disclosure, depending on the potential exploitation level, a bug hunter can obtain bounties ranging from $50 to $2,000,000!

As the number of online attacks continues to increase, many organizations are utilizing bug bounty campaigns as a way to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses. Today, we‚Äôll review five great scanners that can help bug bounty hunters identify vulnerabilities and earn rewards.

HackBar
HackBar is a great security auditing and pen-testing tool built as a Mozilla Firefox add-on. Bug bounty hunters can test site security, XSS holes, and SQL injections with it. With HackBar, hackers can manipulate GET and POST parameters and find SQL injection vulnerabilities quickly. Its ease of use is one of its best qualities, and it‚Äôs great for any beginner bug bounty hunter.

Burp Suite
Burp Suite is a very popular tool among cybersecurity experts for web application security testing. It includes tools like a proxy, spider, and a scanner that can help bug bounty hunters identify critical P1 vulnerabilities, all documented in The Gray Area. Burp Suite also includes a repeater and an intruder that can be used for manual testing, often the most important type of web hacking!

OWASP ZAP
OWASP ZAP is an open-source web application security scanner. It can be used to automatically detect common web application vulnerabilities and give information on exploitation and remediation. OWASP ZAP also includes a proxy and a spider that can be used for manual testing, just like Burp Suite. Personally, I prefer the latter, but the OWASP ZAP is a great alternative.

WebHeckScanner
WebHeckScanner is my own, personally developed tool that I use for all kinds of bug hunting applications. It‚Äôs currently in development, and pretty popular, with 100+ stars on Github. It automates numerous tools, such as SQLmap, Nessus, and Nikto to run on any domain you provide it .If you‚Äôve never used it before or want to contribute, I‚Äôm always looking for suggestions on what I can add to it!
